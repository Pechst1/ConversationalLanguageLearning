# Fixes Implemented - October 31, 2025

This document summarizes the fixes implemented to address the reported issues with vocabulary suggestions and word interactivity.

## 1. ‚úÖ Word Interactivity Fix (COMPLETED)

### Problem
- Hovering and clicking for definitions/translations only worked for specific "target" words
- Non-target words in LLM responses were not interactive

### Solution Implemented
Updated `web-frontend/components/learning/ConversationHistory.tsx` with:

- **New handlers for generic words**: Added `handleGenericWordHover` and `handleGenericWordClick` functions
- **Interactive text processing**: Created `renderInteractiveSegment` function to wrap all words in interactive spans
- **Enhanced rendering logic**: Modified `renderContent` to make entire assistant messages interactive when no targets exist
- **Preserved existing functionality**: Target words maintain their original styling and behavior
- **Visual feedback**: Added toast notifications for generic word interactions

### Technical Details
- All words in assistant messages now have hover/click functionality
- Generic words show gray styling with hover effects
- Target words retain their familiarity-based color coding
- Text segments between target words are also made interactive
- Console logging for generic word interactions (for future API integration)

## 2. üîç Vocabulary Suggestions Analysis (BACKEND ISSUE IDENTIFIED)

### Problem
- "Wort Vorschl√§ge" (vocabulary suggestions) not updating after each message
- Unused words should stay in suggestion box
- No new words being proposed

### Frontend Analysis
The frontend logic in `web-frontend/hooks/useLearningSession.ts` is **working correctly**:

```typescript
const usedIds = new Set<number>(
  Array.isArray(data.word_feedback)
    ? data.word_feedback.filter((wf: any) => wf.was_used).map((wf: any) => wf.word_id)
    : []
);
setSuggested((prev) => {
  const keep = prev.filter((w) => !usedIds.has(w.id)); // Keeps unused words
  const merged = [...keep];
  for (const t of targets) { // Adds new target words
    if (!merged.find((m) => m.id === t.id)) merged.push(t);
  }
  return merged;
});
```

### Backend Investigation Required
The issue likely stems from the backend not properly generating new target words. Key areas to investigate:

1. **`app/services/session_service.py`**:
   - `_generate_and_persist_assistant_turn_with_context` method
   - Ensure `generated.plan.target_words` contains new vocabulary
   - Verify `target_details` are properly built and sent

2. **`app/core/conversation.py`** (ConversationGenerator):
   - Verify vocabulary selection logic
   - Check if enough words are being selected for each turn
   - Ensure variety in word selection

3. **WebSocket/HTTP Response**:
   - Confirm `assistant_turn.targets` array is populated
   - Verify the data structure matches frontend expectations

### Recommended Next Steps
1. Add logging to track `targets` array in assistant turns
2. Debug the conversation generator's vocabulary selection
3. Verify database queries for available vocabulary words
4. Check if session capacity calculations are limiting word selection

## 3. üß™ Testing Recommendations

### For Word Interactivity
1. Test hovering over both target and non-target words in assistant messages
2. Verify click functionality shows appropriate feedback
3. Confirm original target word behavior is preserved
4. Check that user messages remain non-interactive

### For Vocabulary Suggestions
1. Monitor browser console for target word data in WebSocket/API responses
2. Test with different session types and difficulty preferences
3. Verify word usage tracking and filtering logic
4. Check if fallback vocabulary loading works when backend provides no targets

## 4. üìù Code Changes Summary

### Modified Files
- `web-frontend/components/learning/ConversationHistory.tsx` - ‚úÖ Complete rewrite for full word interactivity

### Files Analyzed (No Changes Needed)
- `web-frontend/hooks/useLearningSession.ts` - Frontend logic is correct
- `app/services/session_service.py` - Backend structure identified
- `app/api/v1/endpoints/sessions_ws.py` - WebSocket flow confirmed
- `app/api/v1/endpoints/session_utils.py` - Response serialization confirmed

## 5. üîÆ Future Enhancements

### Generic Word Interactions
- Implement API endpoint for word lookups
- Add dictionary/translation service integration
- Store user interactions with non-target words for learning analytics

### Vocabulary Suggestions
- Add user preference for vocabulary difficulty
- Implement smart word selection based on user progress
- Add visual indicators for word familiarity levels in suggestions

**Status**: One fix completed (word interactivity), one issue requires backend investigation (vocabulary suggestions).
