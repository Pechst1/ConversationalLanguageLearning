# Implementation Plan Aligned with Technical Roadmap

The roadmap is executed in sequential phases. Each phase is broken into concrete tasks and deliverables.

## Phase 1: Core Infrastructure (Week 1-2)

### Day 1-3 — Database Setup *(In Progress)*
- [x] Establish Python project structure following roadmap directory layout.
- [x] Configure configuration management and environment variables.
- [x] Define SQLAlchemy models for all core tables (users, vocabulary, progress, sessions, analytics, achievements).
- [x] Create Alembic environment with initial migration reflecting the schema.
- [x] Implement vocabulary seed script with sample CSV generator.
- [ ] Validate migration against a live PostgreSQL instance.

### Day 4-7 — Authentication & User Management *(In Progress)*
- [x] Implement password hashing and JWT utilities in `app/core/security.py`.
- [x] Create Pydantic schemas for user registration/login flows.
- [x] Build authentication service and FastAPI routes.
- [x] Add integration tests covering registration and login.

### Day 8-10 — Basic API Structure *(In Progress)*
- [x] Initialize FastAPI app with CORS and middleware.
- [x] Implement base routers for users and vocabulary operations.
- [x] Add request validation and OpenAPI documentation enhancements.
- [x] Smoke test endpoints via HTTPX or curl scripts.

## Phase 2: SRS Algorithm (Week 3)
- [x] Implement FSRS algorithm module and scheduler integration.
- [x] Provide unit tests validating interval and rating calculations.
- [x] Expose progress endpoints for vocabulary tracking.

## Phase 3: LLM Integration (Week 4)
- [x] Implement LLM service abstraction with OpenAI/Anthropic providers.
- [x] Build conversation prompt templates and evaluation harness.
- [x] Integrate fallback logic and error handling for conversation generation.
- [x] Deliver rule-based error detection heuristics and spaCy integration.
- [x] Implement conversation generator that merges SRS queues with prompt assembly.
- [x] Wire LLM-assisted error analysis into session flows.

## Phase 4: Session Management (Week 5)
- [x] Implement session creation and lifecycle services.
- [x] Build WebSocket real-time messaging channel.
- [x] Integrate SRS updates and error detection responses.

## Phase 5: Analytics & Polish (Week 6)
- [x] Create analytics service delivering progress summaries.
- [x] Add Redis caching utilities and apply to hot endpoints.
- [ ] Expand automated test suite and documentation.

## Phase 6: Deployment (Week 7)
- [ ] Containerize application and configure docker-compose environments.
- [ ] Set up CI/CD workflow for linting, testing, and migrations.
- [ ] Document deployment runbooks for staging and production.

Progress is tracked in this document and updated as tasks are completed.
